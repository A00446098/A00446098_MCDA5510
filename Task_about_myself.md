I am James Alexander Kyasaram, a Post Graduate Student from Hyderabad, India holding Masters in Applied Statistics. With strong background in Statistics, I want to gain more knowledge in Software development which will help me to become a skilled Analyst capable of carrying out projects from end to end. One academic accomplishment that I'm proud of is ranking 14th in the State level entrance exam for Masters in Statistics at Osmania University, Telangana, India. A mix of my passions and hobbies are Soccer and Hip/Hop-Rapping. I also like to draw pencil sketches in my spare time.

I do have programming experience but not a lot of software development background. I have recently learned MERN stack web development from MOOCs and would like to see some of these concepts covered in the course.

I am good knowledge with languages such as C, C++, Java, C#. I have used PYthon,R in Machine learning projects. I have used JavaScript in Web Development Course. I do not have a lot of familiarity of .NET prior to joining this course.
